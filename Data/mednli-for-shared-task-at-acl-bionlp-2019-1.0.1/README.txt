This is a test set for the NLI shared task at BioNLP 2019. 

The dataset follows the format for previous open domain NLI data such as SNLI and MultiNLI. There are 405 records in this test set. Each test record consists of a premise and hypothesis sentence and the task is to classify the pair into one of the three labels: entailment, contradiction, or neutral. 

There are two files:
- mednli_bionlp_shared_task.jsonl
This file contains the data as a test set. This does not have the label

- mednli_bionlp_shared_task_ground_truth.csv
This file contains the labels for the test set.
